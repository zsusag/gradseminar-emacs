* Outline

** Emacs is extensible and fully customizable.
Nearly every aspect of Emacs can be customized and extended. To some, Emacs is
an entire operating system. But wait, isn't Emacs just a text editor?

*** Emacs is an interpreter.
Nearly all functionality in Emacs is implemented in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][Emacs Lisp (Elisp)]], a
dialect of Lisp. Emacs' "kernel" (written in C) is effectively an interpreter
for Elisp. This enables Emacs to be ported to multiple operating systems and
architectures without having to modify the bulk of the functionality.

**** Emacs is an OS
Many, many, /many/ applications have been developed to extend Emacs'
functionality. The range is actually quite startling; everything from Git
interfaces to PDF viewers, web browsers to email clients --- even [[https://github.com/emacs-exwm/exwm][a
full-featured tiling X window manager]]! Here's [[https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs][a link]] to a list of popular Emacs
packages.

Today, we will focus on two packages in particular: Org Mode and Magit.

*** Config Tour
It might not surprise you at this point to learn that you customize Emacs by
writing Emacs Lisp! Let's take a look at my personal configuration.

**** Emacs is self-documenting
One of the really handy features about Emacs is that you can look up what any
function does with =C-h help-command=.

** Org Mode
Each Emacs buffer has one /major/ mode and some number of /minor/ modes. [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is
#+begin_quote
A GNU Emacs major mode for keeping notes, authoring documents, computational
notebooks, literate programming, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, and
more â€” in a fast and effective plain text system.
#+end_quote

I personally use Org Mode everyday to manage my tasks, calendar, and my notes.

First, we will cover basic Org Mode syntax. Afterwards, I'll briefly showcase my
task management and note taking system.

** Magit
[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is "a complete text-based user interface to Git" inside of Emacs! I'm not
kidding when I say that this package /alone/ might be enough to convince you to
use Emacs.

One of the key benefits of using Org Mode is that everything is stored in
plaintext! This makes it trivial to version control your notes, tasks, and even
calendars!

** For Vim Users
Vim users should be aware that there is a sect within the Emacs community for
you! The [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]] package is an extensible vi layer for Emacs which emulates most of
the main features of Vim.
