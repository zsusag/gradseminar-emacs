What is Emacs, and why learn it?

- Originally named EMACS (Editor MACroS), first developed in the 1970s

- Extensible & customizable

- Also nice to have a text editor where you don't need to take your hands off your keyboard (i.e. use the mouse). It makes things pretty fast!



Before you begin

- bashrc/zshrc: set alias emacs='emacs -nw -f shell' so you can straight-up open emacs on the terminal :)
- Or you can run the GUI version of emacs instead.
- LOTS of Ctrl and Alt (also called Meta)!

Essential commands

- Ctrl-x Ctrl-c to leave emacs
- Ctrl-x Ctrl-f to open a file
- Ctrl-x k to close a buffer
- Ctrl-x Ctrl-s to save
- Ctrl-s to search within buffer
- Ctrl-g to abort search

- WARNING: If running emacs on the terminal, Ctrl-z will pause emacs and take you back to your shell. In this case, typing the command `fg` should take you back to emacs :)

Navigation

If you can't use arrow keys

- Ctrl-f to move forwards/right (by a character)
- Alt-f to move forwards/right (by a word)

- Ctrl-b to move backwards/left
- Alt-b to move backwards/left (by a word)

- Ctrl-p to move up a line
- Ctrl-n to move down a line

Even if you can use home and end keys...

- Ctrl-a to go to beginning of line
- Ctrl-e to go to end of line

Navigating large buffers

- Ctrl-v to move down a whole window
- Alt-v to move up a whole window
- Alt-< (Alt-Shift-,) to jump to the very beginning
- Alt-> (Alt-Shift-.) to jump to the very end

Multiple screens

- Ctrl-x → to move to next screen
- Ctrl-x ← to move to previous screen

Viewing multiple windows

- Ctrl-x 2 to split vertically
- Ctrl-x 3 to split horizontally
- Ctrl-x Ctrl-o to switch between open windows
- Ctrl-x 0 to remove current window
- Ctrl-x 1 to remove all *other* windows

Helpful Commands

- Alt-x followed by command name

- Some commands I like to use:
  - Alt-x shell: opens the shell
  - Alt-x ispell-buffer: spell check
  - Alt-x diff: Perform a diff between two files

Shell

- The best part about having the shell on emacs is that you can easily copy-paste parts of your shell

- The buffer stores your entire shell as well, so you can go super far back

- Scroll fast!

- Alt-/ often fills in the rest of a partially filled word (if there is a matched word previously in the buffer)

- When you're on the command line:
  - Alt-p to go to previous command
  - Alt-n to go to next command
  - Alt-r to search for previously invoked command
